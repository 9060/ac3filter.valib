First order
===========

* Inherit Parser class from Filter class.
* Inherit FileParser class from Source class.
* Check Sync class timing
* Add def_spk and err_spk global constants
* CPUMeter may not work in some cases??? See message from SBN 02.04.2004
* New: Despdifer to demux input SPDIFed stream.
?* Rewrite AudioDecoder & DVDDecoder classes to reorganide decoding process.
  AudioDecoder should understand PCM/PES/SPDIF/MPA/AC3/DTS/[other formats].
  It also should show internal format for containter streams. It should have
  an option to scan PCM input for SPDIF stream that it can possibly contain
  (required to directly play WAV/DTS and WAV/AC3 files prepared for DTS(AC3)/CD.
  DVDDecoder should support SPDIF output, SPDIF passthrough, and decode modes.
* Spdifer test: add more ac3, mpa and dts streams
* clev, slev, lfelev mixing coefs locking
* expand parsers format report
* ac3 encoder test: what is 'strange sample'?
* Tests with negative results as normal result (crash tests for example)
* ac3dec: add SPDIF output
* AudioDecoder SPDIF test: add MPA, DTS, PES/AC3, PES/MPA, PES/DTS
* New: out-of-bounds test for filters (update PCM passthrough test)
* Test suite: add logging to file
* New: Test: correct filter timstamp passthrough
* PCM passthrough test: Multichannel PCM passthrough test failed
* Find classes to make tests for

Tests
=====
* New: MPAParser test
* New: FileParser test
* PESDemux test: add MPEG1 stream test
* PESDemux test: add DTS-PES test

Think about
===========
* think about: cross-platform time measurement (look for liba52 for reference)
* think about: plugin interface
  (main problem is how to set external filter's parameters and UI)
* think about: universal parameter interface
* think about: how to make customizable user interface
* think about: how to use the library in other projects 
  (include directories, required files)
* think about: what to do with A52Parser class
* think about: optimal dynamic range compressor based on gathered statistics
  (after Loudness histogram filter)

Other
=====
* pes_demux: add more statistics during processing
* mpa_iso: add option to disable dithering (for testing purposes)
* New: valdec - Valex Audio Library based DECoder (AC3Player descendant)
* New: decoder & processor .dll
* New: decoder & processor .lib
* New: platform-independent cpu usage interface 
       (to make utils to work in non-win32 environment)
* Modify AC3Enc to use sample_t
* New FFT for AC3 encoder
* remove performance-measure compile options from release builds
  and make special performance-measure builds
* Rename a52dec project and think about to make performance tests
?* Add filter counterpart for parser classes?

Done
====
+* Create script to compile and perform testing
+* timing: time type
+* timing: what to do with AudioSink timing functions?
  [changed to time_t]
+* DTS support with use of dtslib
+* AC3 encoder: remove old encoder from parsers\ac3 and replace with new one
+* BUG: disabling auto matrix does not work
+* BUG: reorder works incorrectly
+* ac3enc: write encoder app
+* ac3 encoder test: multichannel test
+* add PCM Float little-endian format
+* Rename little-endian formats to PCM16LE (for example)
+* AC3 encoder: move tests from ac3enc project to test project
?* Demux test: update
+* New: PCM passthrough test (test for Convertor, Mixer, AGC)
+* PESDemux test: add LPCM test
+* New: Test: filter should process empty chunks without errors
+* New: Test: filter should return empty chunk filter is empty
+* Place main test scripts (which test several files) to main test file
+* New: AudioDecoder SPDIF test
+* BUG: incorrect LFE mixing
+* LFE mixing???
+* Remove SPDIF support from AudioDecoder, and use Spdifer in DVDDecoder
+* PCM passthrough test: 32-bit noise passthrough failed
+* Filters test: AudioDecoder test failed
