First order
===========

* Check Sync class timeing
* Add def_spk and err_spk global constants
* CPUMeter may not work in some cases??? See message from SBN 02.04.2004
* New: Despdifer to demux input SPDIFed stream.
?* Rewrite AudioDecoder & DVDDecoder classes to reorganide decoding process.
  AudioDecoder should understand PCM/PES/SPDIF/MPA/AC3/DTS/[other formats].
  It also should show internal format for containter streams. It should have
  an option to scan PCM input for SPDIF stream that it can possibly contain
  (required to directly play WAV/DTS and WAV/AC3 files prepared for DTS(AC3)/CD.
  DVDDecoder should support SPDIF output, SPDIF passthrough, and decode modes.
* Spdifer test: add more ac3, mpa and dts streams
* clev, slev, lfelev mixing coefs locking
* BUG: negative DRC gain on positive compression 
  (beacuse scaling was moved to Mixer?)
* expand parsers format report
* ac3 encoder test: what is 'strange sample'?
* Tests with negative results as normal result (crash tests for example)
* ac3dec: add SPDIF output
* AudioDecoder SPDIF test: add MPA, DTS, PES/AC3, PES/MPA, PES/DTS
* New: out-of-bounds test for filters (update PCM passthrough test)
* Test suite: add logging to file
* New: Test: correct filter timstamp passthrough
* PCM passthrough test: Multichannel PCM passthrough test failed
* Find classes to make tests for

-------------------------------

-* Add SPDIF output support


-------------------------------
./valib
-------------------------------
First order
===========

?* timing: time conversion functions (time2ms, ms2time, ...)
* SampleBuf: make version without channels?
  (for more optimal buffer usage, see Delay and AGC filters for example)
* PESDemux: check marker bits
* PESDemux: avoid code doubling for packet and streaming operations
* Speakers: level: is it a part of speakers configuration? 
           :level may be part of Chunk()
           :do we need compare levels at Speakers::operator == (and !=)?
* Filter: add method to check if filter can proceed
  (even if filter supports given input format for filter chain or other
  complex filter it is possible that other settings prevents filter from
  working properly)
  [Source::get_output() may return error but filter can still proceed
   see AudioDecoder class as an example]
  current settings (required for FilterChain filter to validate its state)
* Filter: add method to flush internal buffers. flush() call to flush 
  internal buffers + is_flushed() call to know if filter requires flushing.

* Filter: add pull() call: receive data from given source
* Filter: add process_all(): to process entire data from given input to given 
  sink

Other
=====
* Parser: scan data block for sync?
* WriteBS: review class


Done
====
+* optimize: AC3Enc: do not run bit allocation for reused exponents
+* Main filter chain should not care about channel ordering and everything
  should be done in 'standard' channel order. It is responsibility for
  data source/data output filters to convert channel order to comply
  external requirements. So Reorder class should not be a Filter class
  but helper class to help data source/data output filters to reoder
  channels at output/input.
  [reorder is now samples_t member function]
  
+* Optimize: move master gain from AGC to Mixer class
  (AGC will not require scaling when not active)
+* ReadBS: support for different bitstream types (byte, 16bit LE, 16bit BE, etc)
+* Chunk: drop() call to drop N samples from chunk buffer and update time stamp
+* New:Put bitstream class
-* Speakers: add byteorder
   [byteorder is now handled on spk.format and bitstream level]
+* Add GAIN_THRESHOLD constant to compare gains
+* GAIN_CMP macro to compare two gains
+* AudioDecoder does not support bitstream formats for SPDIF formatting
+* Filter: method to obtain output filter format for given input format and
+* AudioSink: rewivew timing (for all sinks)
+* AudioSink: make it Sink descendant?
